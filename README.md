Senior Project Game

Summary:

The character awakes with no previous knowledge of his life with only a sword and cloths on his person. 
He is in a cave with rocks and boulders. Upon exiting the room that he awoke in, he is attacked by monsters that seem to be decrepit and broken down (and none too smart). After destroying the enemies, he continues on to find that doors are either blocked or locked with puzzles that require moving the debris in the room. 
Upon defeating all the enemies (and bosses) and arriving at the last boss, the character uses the pillars the boss is on to destroy him but doing so opens a new path to a seemingly much more well kept dungeon.

Entering this dungeon the character sees enemies similar to the ones he has been fighting but they are completely intact and are much more aggressive/intelligent. 
He also happens upon a human (who assumes the character is a human) being attacked by the monsters. The character and human cannot talk to each other because the character cannot understand the humans language. 
The two become allies of consequence, which is more or less the character feeling the need to move along and the humanâ€™s desire to purge this dungeon. 

The two fight along through more puzzles and enemies until they reach a final boss and treasure room. 
Once the boss is defeated, a wizard teleports into the room, furiously screaming about what has happened. 
The human tries to respond but the wizard brushes off his remarks and strikes him down with one spell. 
The wizard, through his angry rant, belittles the character for not following orders, because the character was made by the wizard (just like all the other creatures) and given the specific task of taking care of the brokendown/rejected creatures that were all stored away in a remote part of the dungeon. 

Possible endings: 

1.Fight the wizard

2.Accept fate and become the new final boss.
